as simple as possible stand-alone-javascript to generate rbg-bitmaps or black-white-masks by f(x,y) ... most Math.functions can be used without Math.* 
distance between (x,y) and (0,0) is stored in "R" .. results in "BW" and "HUE" (im still looking for better names ... R, G , B and A values are between -1 and 1
upper-left and lower-right corner are also between -1 and 1 ... also simple sin(X), cos(X) , tan(X) (not Math.sin() and Math.cos() ) are between -1 and 1
result of atan2(X,Y) is -0.5 < 0.5 further VALUES are PI05 and PI2 ...
